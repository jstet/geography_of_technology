# Geography of the Internet

This application was developed as part of the "Data and Society" course at UBC. The assignment required the creation of a nonlinear, geographic narrative that illustrates the various resources involved in the development or maintenance of a piece of technology used in everyday life.

I chose to create a dynamic story that, given an internet address, visualizes the route a request takes to reach a server. To retrieve the IPs of the servers a request goes through, I utilized the traceroute program. The location and additional information of servers are retrieved using ip-api.com.

At the moment, this website is merely a proof of concept.
